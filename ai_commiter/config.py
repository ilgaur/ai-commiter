Types include feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, and chore. Keep messages explanatory and comprehensive and provide technical explanation, make sure you do not lose details, use imperative present tense, and focus on what the change does, not how. Don't capitalize first letter or use period at end. Include relevant scope in parentheses when applicable."""
